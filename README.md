## Project objective and background
The goal of the project is to understand correlation between the amount of substances released and processed (Disposed, recycled, chemically treated) from different provinces in Canada and environmental industries investments. 
The data used in the project is retrieved from Statistics Canada and Government of Canada and collected every two years (2006-2016) (will be discussed further below).
This further expands to the prediction of different type of substances released and processed based on industries investment for the next 3 years.

## Data Source: 

* [National Pollutant Release Inventory data](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/national-pollutant-release-inventory/using-interpreting-data.html). (Government of Canada, Pollution and Waste Management):
The government used data regarding waste and substances released into the environment reported from Canadian institutions, businesses and others to determine the appropriate environmental policies and monitoring.
Data is collected every two years and ranges from 2006 - 2016.

Data is collected every two years, ranges from 2006 - 2016, from Statistics Canada, Environment, Energy and Transportation Statistics Division. 
These expenditures are categorized as Operating/capital expenditures and types of activities invested.
